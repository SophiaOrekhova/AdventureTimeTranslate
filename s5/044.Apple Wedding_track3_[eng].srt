Cinnamon Bun!

8
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,410
What the heck are you
doing out in the woods?

9
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,960
I asked you 20 minutes ago to
take these drinks around for us.

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,420
Oh. Oh!

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,130
"Around for us"!

12
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,880
I thought you said "Walk
to the zoo and back."

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
Gah!

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,680
Finn,

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,930
Cinnamon Bun's gonna
tend the juice bar now.

16
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,760
I have a special job for you.

17
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,940
As Ooo's greatest champion,
I'm relying on you to keep

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,610
Lumpy Space Princess from
crashing this wedding.

19
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,570
I went ahead and deputized you,
so, you know, no holds barred.

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,440
Got it?

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,700
Yeah!

22
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,200
Oh. But what about Jake?

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,410
Well, honestly, I haven't seen
Jake this happy in a while.

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,630
I kind of don't want
to squash his groove.

25
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,700
Hands off, little piggies!

26
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,630
Knock knock!

27
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,880
Hey, Tree Trunks!

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,460
Oh, hey, Princess.

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,760
Wow!

30
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,300
You look prettier than a
sippy cup in a snow bank.

31
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,260
Thanks, Tree Trunks.

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,680
Now listen... I don't want
you to worry about a thing.

33
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,560
I've got Finn on LSP duty, and
we're keeping your ex-husbands,

34
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,310
Randy, Danny, and Wyatt, 100
feet apart at all times,

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,140
at least until it's time for
me to perform the ceremony.

36
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,100
Oh, well, uh, Princess...

37
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,940
I appreciate your generosity,

38
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,200
going to all this trouble to
hijack my wedding and all,

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,000
but you can't perform
the ceremony.

40
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,870
What?!

41
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,740
Why not?

42
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,830
Well, I'm sorry, but I just don't
recognize your "authority"

43
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,510
on such matters.

44
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,550
I can only be married
by his holiness,

45
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,220
the one true king of Ooo.

46
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,140
What?!

47
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,300
That fraud?!

48
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,630
Now, I know his teachings...

49
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,510
That fraud is here?!

50
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,510
Uh, why, yes, but...

51
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,060
Oh, dear.

52
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,440
Mama, I'm afraid I've
offended the Princess.

53
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,480
Oh, nonsense, baby.

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,030
She's probably just jealous
'cause you're about to marry

55
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,950
such a handsome,
fine, saucy man!

56
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,740
Oh, but he is a saucy
fine bolog-nah factory!

57
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,820
Mm-hmm!

58
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,860
I'll tell you what.

59
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,780
I'd like to open up that hood,
see how the bolog-nah gets made!

60
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,240
Mm!

61
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,920
Mama, please!

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,670
Please don't call him a saucy,
fine bolog-nah factory!

63
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,670
Bolog-nah factory!

64
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,750
Oh! My perfect day!

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,880
What else could go wrong?

66
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,010
Please go on... describe
the next "Thought-form."

67
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,970
Um... l see, like,
reddish-green blotches.

68
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,480
Ah! Ha ha ha!

69
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,690
One year good luck.

70
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,030
I've waited a long time
for this, king of Ooo.

71
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,530
And now I'm gonna expose you in

72
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,700
front of everyone for
what you really are.

73
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,700
Yay!

74
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,580
H-hey, barkeep, can I have
another one of these ciders?

75
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,830
Sure!

76
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,420
Hey, little robot,
how you doing?

77
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,850
I am the best!

78
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,720
I love weddings, I love flowers,
I love I-o-o-o-o-o-o-ove!

79
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,850
Hey, did you know I used to
be married to Tree Trunks?

80
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,480
N-o-o-o-o-o-o!

81
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,150
Heh, yeah.

82
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,320
It was just me and T.T.

83
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,610
We had some wild times
back in the day.

84
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,910
Did you know I once took
her to play tennis?

85
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,980
N-o-o-o-o!

86
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,690
Yep. Tennis.

87
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,070
I took her to one of those,

88
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,250
uh... paddles or
whatever, you know?

89
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
No.

90
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, she left me.

91
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,500
She said I was
stifling her spirit.

92
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,170
I mean...

93
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,960
You know, what... Not
enough tennis for you?

94
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,250
No...

95
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,470
It's starting!

96
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,550
The ceremony is starting!

97
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:40,900
<i>♪ La ♪</i>

98
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,490
Oh, no!

99
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,790
I'm missing the love!

100
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,910
No!

101
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,620
Uh... please, stay here.

102
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,200
This is cathartic.

103
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,290
You're a good listener.

104
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,830
Oh.

105
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,290
Okay.

106
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,970
Sweetie, you look so nice.

107
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,840
Shh.

108
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,800
Sounds really sweet.

109
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,020
Lumpy Space Princess?

110
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,090
Is that you?

111
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,430
Let me go to this part-y-y-y!

112
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,060
Aah!

113
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,730
It's not your party, LSP.

114
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,280
Poor Finn.

115
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,400
Don't you know?

116
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,150
Every party...

117
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,730
is <i>my</i> Party!

118
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,880
I'm just gonna look
in this guy's blimp,

119
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,960
make sure everything's
in accordance...

120
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,130
with the laws.

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,840
Psst!

122
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,590
Sweetie, what're you doing'?

123
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,670
Hmm?

124
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,640
Get out of my way, Finn!

125
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,890
Oh, my glob!

126
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,720
You're touching my woman's body!

127
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Okay, dear.

128
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,190
Now up you come.

129
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,990
Don't hurry this.

130
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,110
Here we go.

131
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,990
Whoa, whoa, kids!

132
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,790
Got to finish the
ceremony first.

133
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,290
Keep the baby in the basket.

134
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,000
Everyone at the party get ready

135
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,540
'cause here comes a
hot bunch of grapes!

136
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,960
Aaaaaaaaah!

137
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,960
Oh, my glob!

138
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,010
We've gathered here on
this beautiful day,

139
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,430
under my life-giving sun,

140
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,720
to celebrate the
enjointment of Mr. Pig

141
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,470
and Tree Trunks, the
little elephant.

142
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,770
These two weird animals first...

143
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,730
Oh, I bet some cute weddings
are happening over there.

144
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,230
BMO, you're so nice.

145
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,940
Those flowers look really cool.

146
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,370
Oh, I've had a hard life.

147
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,790
People seem cute.

148
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,240
They seem nice.

149
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,820
But then when you can't stop
crying because they beat you

150
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,710
at tennis that one time,
they call you a baby!

151
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,630
Yeah, cute nice babies.

152
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,750
BMO?

153
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,670
Mm-hmm?

154
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,870
BMO, would you move in with me?

155
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,840
Do you, Mr. Pig take Tree Trunks
to be your ever-wedded wife,

156
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,470
forever following the
teachings of me,

157
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,300
the true king of Ooo?

158
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,390
I do.

159
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,310
And do you, Tree Trunks...

160
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,190
do you promise to love Mr.
Pig forever

161
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,030
and spend the next five years
with me in my serenity compound,

162
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,780
performing simple
household repairs,

163
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,450
to have and to hold, in
sickness and in health,

164
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,370
in my gated mountain compound?

165
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,620
<i>I...</i>

166
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,080
everybody get ready...

167
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,330
to pay attention to me!

168
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,960
I-I-I-I-I-I...

169
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,260
I-I-I-I-I-I'd-

170
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,830
Oh!

171
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,010
Ev-everybody! Hey!

172
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,510
I'm here!

173
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,460
Look at my bouq...

174
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,840
Unh!

175
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,220
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

176
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,350
Ahh!

177
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,480
My Zep!

178
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,160
Everybody, this
wedding is a farce!

179
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,700
A <i>criminal</i> farce!

180
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,570
Hey, just what are
you egging at here?

181
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,650
I'll tell you what
I'm egging at.

182
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,540
I'm egging at this outdated
wedding-officiant license!

183
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,120
Oh!

184
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,700
Oh, is that what this is about?

185
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,750
You must've found that
in my back records.

186
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,380
I have the up-to-date
paperwork right here.

187
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,580
Oh!

188
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,460
What?

189
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,420
Uh...

190
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,300
Hey, wait.

191
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,300
How did you get that?

192
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,010
I could've swore it
was locked in my zep.

193
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:36,890
Nope! Shh!

194
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,970
Nope' nope, nope!

195
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,430
Stop talking! Go to jail!

196
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,640
Oh!

197
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Yeah.

198
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,730
Princess Bubblegum, you
have gone too far.

199
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,610
We stand together
against your tyranny.

200
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,530
Hey, everybody.

201
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,240
Your prison may hold one of us,
but it may not hold all of us.

202
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,620
Oh, poor Tree Trunks.

203
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,670
Wait. Where's my mama?

204
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,910
Has anyone see my...

205
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,340
Oh!

206
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,420
No, mama!

207
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,170
Well, I guess this
is it, sweetie.

208
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,170
Oh. Oh, no.

209
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,180
The elephant graveyard
is calling to me now.

210
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,220
Okay, hold your horses.

211
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,140
<i>I'm comin'.</i>

212
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,760
Wait, Tree Trunks!

213
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,350
Look around!

214
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,480
Everyone we care about
is all here together.

215
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,680
Finn, Uncle Donald,

216
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,270
Banana Guard ♪1, Jake,
Jake Jr., everybody!

217
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,360
We could have the
ceremony right here.

218
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,780
Hey, yeah!

219
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,410
King of Ooo, will
you do the honors?

220
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,530
Are you crazy?!

221
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,710
That loopy bird is gonna
string me up sideways!

222
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,790
You can perform your
own dang ceremony!

223
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,590
Kingofooo.com!

224
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,210
Oh. Oh, dear.

225
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,210
Oh, my gosh.

226
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,340
Tree Trunks, did you hear?

227
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,540
Huh?

228
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,300
The king said you could perform
your own dang ceremony.

229
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,720
Yeah, that really stung.

230
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,970
But...

231
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,050
but... the king's word is law.

232
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,510
I can perform my
own dang ceremony?

233
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,520
Are you up to it, T.T.?

234
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,320
I'll try.

235
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,240
I guess it's time.

236
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,030
A-are you ready?

237
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,330
Oh, okay. Urn, uh...

238
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,500
Do you, Mr. Pig, take
me, Tree Trunks,

239
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,250
to be your beautiful
wedded wife?

240
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,790
I do.

241
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:33,000
And do I, Mr. Pig, take him to
be your lawful wedded husband,

242
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,330
Tree Trunks?

243
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,960
I do.

244
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,170
Then, you...

245
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,100
you may kiss the bride.

246
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,590
Mwah!

247
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680

Uh... what?

250
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,320
I just can't stay mad
at something so cute.

251
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,940
Did she just say
"Let everyone go"?

252
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,280
Looks like we've got the
whole place to ourselves,

253
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,660
if you know what I'm saying.

254
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,790
Wait. D-don't you think there
might be cameras down here?

255
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,250
I hope so.
