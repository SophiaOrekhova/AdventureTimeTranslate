He's heading
for that cupe!

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,610
Come on, Jake.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,880
Oh, yeah.

10
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,390
What?! He's gone.

11
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,990
What? What happened?

12
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,090
Hey, hey!

13
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,800
Did you guys see that?

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,700
You know that was a ghost
wearing a dead guy?

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,600
That might be the nastiest
thing I've ever seen.

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,540
N-n-n-n-nasty, nasty Jazz.

17
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,700
Nast...

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,140
Hey, hey! Easy, buddy.

19
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,440
That's our friend Billy.

20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,280
He got possessed
by the Lich!

21
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,480
Oh, sorry! Sorry.

22
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,710
I didn't mean nothin' by it.

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,380
I mean, I have a
lot of nasty friends.

24
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,890
My uncle was nasty.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,950
I'm basically
honorary nasty.

26
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,290
Do you know
where he went?

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,690
We have to find our friend.

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,820
Who knows.

29
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,520
Uh... oh.

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,500
Actually, it depends on
the wish I granted him.

31
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,500
Wish?

32
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,730
Yeah, he wished for the
extinction of all life,

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,930
and I did it.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,370
I guess it changed his
timeline or something.

35
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,870
What?! Oh, glob!!

36
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,840
Whoa, wait a minute.

37
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,670
How can that be if
I'm still here kickin'

38
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,570
it with my main man,
Finn?

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,410
Oh, that's because you're
safe in my time room

40
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,210
until you make <i>your</i> wish.

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,350
Oh-h-h-h.

42
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,320
I wish that life
wasn't anymore exti...

43
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,680
Whoa! Wait, Jake.

44
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,950
Don't mess this up.

45
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,010
Think about it.

46
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,560
If we wish everything
back to normal,

47
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,060
the Lich could just
jazz it up again.

48
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,220
Oh, yeah.

49
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,290
Jazz.

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,850
Hmm.

51
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,660
Hmm.

52
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,960
Hm-m-m-m.

53
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,090
I got it!

54
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,540
I wish...

55
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,730
The Lich...

56
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,610
never...

57
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,340
even ever existed.

58
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,150
Mom?

59
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,440
Mom, what's wrong?

60
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,380
Finn, I need you to
do something for me.

61
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,390
It's very important.

62
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,550
I need you to take
the mule into

63
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,060
town today and sell him
for as much as you can.

64
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,960
What?

65
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,080
Sell Bartram?

66
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,250
But I love Bartram.
What the heck, mom?!

67
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,260
Shh!

68
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,660
Finn, please.
Just do as I say.

69
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,430
- Got it?
- Dad?

70
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,230
I push you.
You fall down.

71
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,700
The Destiny Gang?

72
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,670
Finn, please.

73
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,400
Everything will be fine,
I promise.

74
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,910
Now, just do as I say.

75
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,440
I'm sorry, Bartram.

76
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,110
I guess dad must be in real
trouble to be doing this.

77
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,520
But I bet there's a lot of fine
folk lookin' to buy a good mule.

78
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,250
Why, I bet I could even
come visit sometimes.

79
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,520
Won't that be swell,
Bartram?

80
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,030
Bartram?

81
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,530
Dang it, Bartram.

82
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,790
Bar-bar?

83
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,200
What the...

84
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,930
Bar-bar, how'd you
get up there?

85
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,730
Jake, look!

86
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,330
A golden crown!

87
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,710
Unbelievable!

88
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,510
We can sell it
<i>and</i> keep Bartram!

89
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,550
Bong bong!

90
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,050
Hold it right there!

91
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,550
Who are you?

92
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,990
I'm a thousand years old,
and this is <i>my</i> crown.

93
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,110
Okay, okay.

94
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,780
But, um...

95
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,590
maybe I could just...
borrow it for a little while?

96
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,490
No!

97
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,550
No! No!

98
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,690
This crown is magic.

99
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,670
Bad, terrible magic.

100
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,260
Too dangerous for mortal
fingies like yours!

101
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,400
One thousand years ago, my
beloved friend, Simon Petrikov,

102
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,040
gave his life to
save this foolish,

103
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,570
unworthy planet
from annihilation.

104
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,780
A frightful bomb
was poised to

105
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,950
bathe the land
in mutogenic horror.

106
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,650
But using his mastery
of ice and snow,

107
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,100
Simon froze the bomb in
mid-flight only inches

108
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,220
from the ground,

109
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,030
where it remains to
this very day,

110
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,160
today,

111
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,930
ever-ripe and
ready to blow.

112
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,440
But he alone
was not saved.

113
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,210
Trapped under the giant weight
of the enormous bomb,

114
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,250
poor Simon perished.

115
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,510
Little help?

116
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,710
And the horrible crown,
grieving its lost master,

117
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,310
loosed a spasm of magic
so wild and crazy,

118
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:53,190
the entire Earth was buried
in ice for 400 boring years.

119
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,660
Uh...

120
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,100
None of that is true,
'cause magic is fake.

121
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,570
Daddy says the false prophets
of old used cheap parlor tricks

122
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,830
to control the people,
and to get babes,

123
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,880
like 10 or 12
hot babes each.

124
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,470
No! Magic is real!

125
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,380
Lady, you been
down here too long.

126
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:14,110
- Why don't you just let...
- Step off, or I will use this!

127
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,680
Lady, quit it
with that thing!

128
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,350
I'm sorry.

129
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,080
You must die!

130
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,190
Aah?

131
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,150
Ooh.

132
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,790
Um...

133
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,630
Oh, man!

134
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,460
This thing...
dang it!

135
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,470
Go, Jake!

136
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,530
Aah!

137
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,770
Go back to the underworld, you beast!

138
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,010
Sorry!

139
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,100
I got to save my dad.

140
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,170
Destroy the world,
more like!

141
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,010
Dummy!

142
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,280
I give up.

143
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,750
<i>The crown...</i>

144
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,250
<i>Go get it.</i>

145
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,850
I know you're not
really talking to me.

146
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,450
I'm not crazy!

147
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,220
<i>Get the crown!</i>

148
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,420
<i>Go get it!</i>

149
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,060
<i>Get the crown, Marceline!</i>

150
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,120
<i>Go get it!</i>

151
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,530
I can't...
my knees!

152
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,830
<i>Well, that's real</i>ly
<i>disappointing, I must say.</i>

153
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,830
<i>I'm just...</i>

154
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,030
<i>Well, whatever.</i>

155
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,730
<i>You're really letting</i>
<i>me down right now.</i>

156
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,570
Okay. All right.

157
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,070
Cool crown!

158
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,410
Who wants a cool crown?!

159
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,210
I found it on a
dead magician dude!

160
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,250
I'll take it.

161
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,150
Awesome!

162
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,210
How much cash you got?

163
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,910
Oh, I'm poor.

164
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,220
Uh, but what about I trade
you for a personal concert

165
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,520
at your house?

166
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,850
I'll come over later and
sing you like four songs.

167
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,590
I mostly do covers,
but I have originals, too.

168
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,760
Do you own any spoons?

169
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,960
No.

170
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,160
Let me see that!

171
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,260
Hey!

172
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,200
Heh.

173
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,730
Wait. Destiny Gang.

174
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,570
I got to sell that
to pay you guys!

175
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,510
Trami, what you think?

176
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,200
Is it my style?

177
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,610
Big Destiny will know.

178
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,810
Yo, boss!

179
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,940
Snap!

180
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,710
Huh? What is this?

181
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,750
Are you telling me
what to wear, Trami?

182
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,980
No, boss!
You look good!

183
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,790
You think I should
re-invent my style

184
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,160
and put a stupid thing
on my head?!

185
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,390
No, man!

186
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,120
You tell <i>us</i> what to wear!

187
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,220
Otherwise, you would
dress like an idiot!

188
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,360
Bam! Crown shorts.

189
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,920
Amazing!

190
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,800
Yeah-ha-hah.

191
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,970
Clap harder, trash bag.

192
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,770
Okay, you guys.

193
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,840
Give me my money or
leave my parents alone.

194
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,820
Property of old dead person
go to Big Destiny.

195
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,910
One arm needs to
learn the rules,

196
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,180
unless you want your
butt handed to you.

197
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,280
I guess it wasn't
really mine.

198
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,920
It's mine!
I'm a demon.

199
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,050
Half demon.

200
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,190
Tromo, jack up crazy lady.

201
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,960
Trami, take mule back
to crib for din-din.

202
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,090
What?!

203
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,070
Bar-bar!

204
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,370
Tough luck, one-arm!

205
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,270
See you soon,
bad style junk town!

206
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,070
Bar-bar.

207
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,020
End of the road, bat lady.

208
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,350
Oww, my bones!

209
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,520
Aah!

210
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,920
My eye!

211
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,290
I will junk your face!

212
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,880
What the...

213
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,020
Destiny Gang,
get out of town!

214
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,500
We're sick of
being bullied around!

215
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,690
Yeah!

216
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,530
You make big mistake!

217
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,400
Especially you, one-arm.

218
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,130
My name is Finn Mertens!

219
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,180
And tell Big "D"
I'm coming for my stuff!

220
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Oh, you come and try!

221
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,540
Are you okay, lady?

222
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,080
You must promise to...

223
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,950
promise to return the crown
to its hide-hole.

224
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,210
I promise.

225
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,690
You'll need this, Finn,
if you want to win.

226
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,920
Choose Bruce.

227
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,890
What is it?

228
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,760
It's a weapon for your arm.

229
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,590
With this,
you will defend from harm!

230
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,630
Hmm.

231
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,460
Feels natural,
like peeing outside.

232
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,800
Sort of.

233
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,100
Best not to take the lift,
my friend,

234
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,200
else the D-Gang
will see you coming in!

235
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,260
No.

236
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,000
I want them to see me.

237
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,340
I'm-a go up there and
show them my face!!

238
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,750
Aah?

239
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,260
Hello?

240
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,620
Bar-bar? I'm coming!

241
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,320
Bar-bar!

242
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,260
I want my stuff, you big dump.

243
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,990
You want Big D's crown, huh?

244
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,160
Yeah!

245
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,210
And Bar-bar!

246
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,140
Here you go, then.

247
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,140
Wha...?

248
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,070
That is your
final possession,

249
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,410
the last thing you
will ever own.

250
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,380
What do you... mean?

251
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,150
Look down there, stupid.

252
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,350
Town is on fire, see?

253
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,980
I made it on fire.

254
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,390
Fix up junk town.

255
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,790
Look at old man cry!

256
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,760
That's what happens
when you mess with Big D!

257
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,200
You get crush!

258
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,820
Your family get crush!

259
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,060
Boo-yah!

260
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,830
Suck my shirt!!

261
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,570
Jump!

262
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,900
Choose Bruce!

263
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,440
All my stuff is "goan!"

264
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,740
Now they're going after your...

265
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,280
Home!

266
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,880
Bar-bar, come on!

267
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,820
Hurry, Finn!

268
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,950
You can win!

269
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,660
Finn!

270
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,590
Return...

271
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,650
I will.

272
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,160
But we got to stop
the D-Gang first.

273
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,200
Come on, Jake!

274
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,360
Good boy!

275
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,200
Destiny!

276
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,200
Destiny!

277
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,140
No-o-o-o!!

278
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,240
Yeah!

279
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,680
How did I even
get here, son?!

280
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,940
Mom! Dad!

281
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,540
- Finn!
- No!

282
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,720
You said this
thing is magic?

283
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,850
Yes, powerful and dangerous.

284
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,330
But you lost your
mind in a cave.

285
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,450
Whatever.

286
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,290
You just got to
believe me, okay?

287
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,990
For serious,
you donk!

288
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,760
I am Big D!!

289
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,360
Whoo!!

290
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,870
I believe you.

291
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,840
You do?

292
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,670
